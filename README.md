# Energy Consumption Forecasting with Prophet

This repository contains the code and datasets used for forecasting energy consumption based on data from Sense.com using Facebook's Prophet time series forecasting tool. The project focuses on predicting future energy consumption based on historical data gathered from Sense.com's smart energy monitoring devices.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to provide accurate forecasts of energy consumption using data from Sense.com. By analyzing historical consumption data from various devices monitored by Sense.com, this project aims to predict future energy usage, which can be critical for efficient energy management, cost reduction, and understanding consumption patterns. The forecasting model is built using the Prophet library, designed to handle time series data with daily or sub-daily observations.
